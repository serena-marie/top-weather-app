# Weather App

This app uses the weather API to search a city and display the current weather. The end user can set their "ideal" temperature, which the app will tell them how far away the current temperature is from their ideal temperature.

### Features coming soon
- Option to display temp in celcius
- Background image will update based on the weather condition
- Celebrate when ideal temp is met, as a lil treat
- Loading component
